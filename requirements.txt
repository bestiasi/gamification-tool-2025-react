# Project Dependencies

This project uses Node.js and npm (or yarn) to manage dependencies.

All project dependencies are listed in the `package.json` file:

-   **`dependencies`**: These are packages required for the application to run in production.
-   **`devDependencies`**: These are packages needed only for local development and testing (e.g., linters, build tools, testing libraries).

## Installing Dependencies

To install all necessary dependencies, navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run:

Using npm:
```bash
npm install
```

Or using yarn:
```bash
yarn install
```

This command will download and install all packages listed in `package.json` into the `node_modules` directory (which is typically ignored by version control, see `.gitignore`).

## Adding New Dependencies

To add a new runtime dependency:

Using npm:
```bash
npm install <package-name>
```

Or using yarn:
```bash
yarn add <package-name>
```

To add a new development dependency:

Using npm:
```bash
npm install <package-name> --save-dev
```

Or using yarn:
```bash
yarn add <package-name> --dev
```

These commands will install the package and automatically update your `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`) files.
